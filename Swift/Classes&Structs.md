In SwiftUI, the choice between using a **struct** or a **class** depends on the role of the component within your app. SwiftUI encourages the use of **structs for views** and **classes for state management** or interoperability with UIKit components.

### **ContentView as a Struct**

In SwiftUI, **views are typically defined as structs**. This is because structs are value types and SwiftUI uses value semantics to efficiently manage and update the UI.

**Example of ContentView:**

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```

- **Why Struct?**
  - **Performance**: Structs are lightweight and SwiftUI can easily detect changes.
  - **Immutability**: Encourages a predictable UI by avoiding unintended side effects.
  - **Value Semantics**: Simplifies the diffing process for UI updates.

### **WebViewHandler: Struct or Class?**

A `WebViewHandler` often needs to manage state, conform to delegate protocols, and interact with UIKit components like `WKWebView`. In such cases, **using a class is appropriate**, especially when you need reference semantics or compatibility with Objective-C protocols.

**Example of WebViewHandler as a Class:**

```swift
import SwiftUI
import WebKit
import Combine

class WebViewHandler: NSObject, ObservableObject, WKNavigationDelegate {
    @Published var pageTitle: String = ""
    var webView: WKWebView

    override init() {
        self.webView = WKWebView()
        super.init()
        self.webView.navigationDelegate = self
    }

    func loadURL(_ url: URL) {
        webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
    }

    // WKNavigationDelegate method
    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.pageTitle = webView.title ?? ""
        }
    }
}
```

- **Why Class?**
  - **Reference Semantics**: Needed when the instance is shared and mutated across different parts of the app.
  - **ObservableObject**: Allows SwiftUI views to observe changes and update accordingly.
  - **Conformance to NSObject**: Necessary for adopting certain UIKit/AppKit protocols.
  - **Delegate Pattern**: Classes are required to conform to Objective-C protocols like `WKNavigationDelegate`.

**Integrating WebViewHandler with SwiftUI:**

```swift
struct WebViewContainer: UIViewRepresentable {
    @ObservedObject var webViewHandler: WebViewHandler

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> WKWebView {
        return webViewHandler.webView
    }

    func updateUIView(_ uiView: WKWebView, context: Context) {
        // Optional: Handle updates to the view
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var webViewHandler = WebViewHandler()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Page Title: \(webViewHandler.pageTitle)")
                .padding()
            WebViewContainer(webViewHandler: webViewHandler)
                .onAppear {
                    if let url = URL(string: "https://www.example.com") {
                        webViewHandler.loadURL(url)
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```

- **`@StateObject`**: Used to initialize an observable object that persists across view updates.
- **`@ObservedObject`**: Used within `WebViewContainer` to observe changes in `webViewHandler`.
- **`UIViewRepresentable`**: Bridges UIKit components to SwiftUI.

### **When to Use Structs vs. Classes in SwiftUI**

#### **Use Structs When:**

- **Defining Views**: Almost all your SwiftUI views should be structs conforming to the `View` protocol.
- **Value Semantics Suffice**: When you don't need reference semantics or shared mutable state.

#### **Use Classes When:**

- **Managing State with Reference Semantics**: Use classes conforming to `ObservableObject` for shared, mutable state.
- **Interoperability with UIKit/AppKit**: When working with UIKit components or Objective-C protocols that require classes.
- **Complex Data Models**: For data models that need identity or are passed around extensively.

### **Understanding Property Wrappers in SwiftUI**

- **`@State`**: For simple, local state within a view (struct). Value type.
- **`@Binding`**: To pass state between views. Value type.
- **`@ObservedObject`**: To observe an `ObservableObject` without owning it.
- **`@StateObject`**: To create and own an instance of an `ObservableObject`.
- **`@EnvironmentObject`**: For shared data that is injected into the environment.

### **Example of Using a Class for Shared State**

```swift
class UserSettings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username: String = ""
}

struct SettingsView: View {
    @ObservedObject var settings: UserSettings

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Username", text: $settings.username)
    }
}

struct ProfileView: View {
    @ObservedObject var settings: UserSettings

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, \(settings.username)")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var userSettings = UserSettings()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            SettingsView(settings: userSettings)
            ProfileView(settings: userSettings)
        }
    }
}
```

- **Shared State**: `UserSettings` is shared between `SettingsView` and `ProfileView`.
- **ObservableObject**: Updates to `username` are published, and views observing `userSettings` are updated.

### **Summary**

- **Views as Structs**: Use structs for your SwiftUI views to leverage value semantics and SwiftUI's optimization.
- **State Management with Classes**: Use classes conforming to `ObservableObject` for shared or complex state management.
- **Interoperability**: Use classes when you need to interact with UIKit components or Objective-C protocols.
- **WebViewHandler as a Class**: Since it manages a `WKWebView` and uses delegate methods, implementing it as a class is appropriate.

### **Best Practices**

- **Keep Views Lightweight**: Views should be simple and focus on the UI layout.
- **Separate Concerns**: Business logic and state management should be handled outside of the view structs.
- **Use Property Wrappers Appropriately**: Understand the purpose of each property wrapper to manage state effectively.
- **Leverage SwiftUI's Data Flow**: Design your app to follow SwiftUI's reactive data flow for better performance and maintainability.
